            <h1>A Brief Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                I am currently a college student at Ozark Technical Community
                College. My major is in Computer Sciences. I chose this major
                because I enjoy learning and I know that I will continue learning
                new and exciting things as technology grows.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have a beautiful little family with my husband and our two kids.
                They mean the world to me. My biggest motivation in life is to
                provide a bright future for my kids.</p>
            <p>
                In my free time I enjoy video games, reading, and a few different
                crafts. Iâ€™m always looking to try something new.
