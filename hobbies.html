            One of my favorite hobbies is crocheting. I have been crocheting for around 2 years now. I
            enjoy making clothing, stuffed animals, and many other wonderful crafts for friends and
            family. I taught myself how to crochet by watching YouTube videos and following along.
            Before long I was hooked (pun intended), and now I have an entire closet full of different
            yarns.

            Another hobby I thoroughly enjoy is baking. My favorite thing to bake is a pecan pie
            cheesecake. It’s always a hit at family dinners, and I usually have to make two. I especially
            enjoy baking with my kids. They have so much fun and I get to teach them the way my
            great grandma taught me.

            My longest standing hobby has been reading. From a very young age I started reading
            books like Harry Potter, Artemis Fowl, and Goosebumps. It wasn’t long before I was diving
            head first into the realm of Fantasy and Science Fiction. Growing up it was uncommon to
            see me with less than two or three books in my back pack.
